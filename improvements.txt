Core Logic & AI Improvements

   1. Implement Color & Style Coordination (DONE): The recommendation engine now utilizes a scoring system that prioritizes items with complementary colors and matching styles (e.g., 'Streetwear' with 'Streetwear'), moving beyond simply picking the least-recently-worn item.
   2. Normalize Insulation Scale: There's a mismatch between the AI's 1-5 insulation scale and the recommendation engine's 1-10 scale. This should be fixed to make
      temperature-based recommendations more accurate.
   3. Create Flexible Outfit Templates: Move beyond the hardcoded ['Top', 'Bottom', 'Footwear', 'Outerwear'] structure. Define different outfit templates (e.g., [Dress,
      Footwear], [Top, Bottom, Footwear]) and have the engine select the best one.
   4. Utilize AI-Generated Descriptions: The AI generates detailed descriptions for each item. Use a lightweight model or NLP library to compare these descriptions for
      semantic similarity, improving outfit cohesion.
   5. Pre-filter Wardrobe in Database: Instead of fetching the entire wardrobe every time, add basic filters to the Supabase query to exclude obviously unsuitable items
      (e.g., don't fetch winter coats if it's hot).
   6. Incorporate User Preferences: The recommendation engine currently fetches but does not use user preferences. Add logic to boost the score of items that match the
      user's preferred colors or styles.
   7. "Why This Outfit?" Feature Enhancement: The reasoning string is a great start. Enhance it to be more user-facing, explaining why the items match (e.g., "The blue in
      the shirt complements the denim jeans.").
   8. Learn from User Feedback: Add like/dislike buttons to recommendations and use this data to fine-tune the recommendation algorithm (e.g., learn which color combos
      the user prefers).

  UI/UX Enhancements

   9. Allow Manual Location Setting: On the main page, if geolocation fails, allow the user to manually search for and set their location instead of defaulting to New
      York.
   10. Batch Wardrobe Management: In the wardrobe, add the ability for users to select multiple items to delete or tag them at once.
   11. Visual Outfit Builder/Editor: Create a new page where users can manually mix and match items from their wardrobe on a canvas to create and save their own outfits.
   12. "Shop My Wardrobe" View: Add a feature that shows the user all possible outfits they can make with a specific item, encouraging them to rediscover their clothes.
   13. Improved Filter UI: On the wardrobe page, enhance the filter panel with visual filters, like a color palette for color filtering.
   14. Onboarding Tutorial: Create a brief, interactive onboarding tour for new users, guiding them through adding their first item and getting their first recommendation.

  Feature & Functionality Additions

   15. Implement the 'Occasion' Feature: The occasion parameter is currently unused. Implement logic in the recommendation engine to filter items based on the occasion tag
       (e.g., 'Work', 'Date Night').
   16. Packing List Generator: Create a new feature where a user can input a destination and trip duration, and the app generates a packing list based on the predicted
       weather and the user's wardrobe.
   17. Track Cost-Per-Wear: Allow users to add a purchase price for their clothing items. The app can then calculate and display the cost-per-wear each time an item is
       logged.
   18. Community Outfits/Lookbook: Add a social feature where users can (optionally) share their favorite generated or manually created outfits to a public lookbook for
       inspiration.
   19. Weather API Fallback: Implement a fallback mechanism to a secondary weather provider if the primary one fails.
   20. Settings Page Expansion: Expand the settings page to allow users to configure recommendation parameters, such as how many days to wait before recommending an item
       again.
