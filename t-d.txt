Foundation: Design System (tokens, type, spacing)
Color tokens (Tailwind v4 @theme)

Establish a premium dark-first palette with tonal surfaces (Material 3 guidance: color for elevation instead of heavy shadows).
Add tokens: background, surface, surface-2, surface-3, text, text-muted, primary, primary-foreground, success, warning, error, border, ring.
Ensure strong contrast and dark-mode ergonomics; consider OKLCH values for perceptual consistency.
Rationale: You currently mix light (gray-50) and custom dark theme. Unify across all pages for a premium, cohesive feel.
Typography

Replace Nunito Sans with a premium neo-grotesk: Inter, Geist, Plus Jakarta Sans, Satoshi, or General Sans.
Set a clear type scale for mobile-first:
Display: 28–32, Headline: 22–24, Title: 18–20, Body: 16, Caption: 13–14.
Line-height: 1.4–1.6 for body; tracking-tight on large headings.
Rationale: Stronger hierarchy and legibility; instantly reads as premium.
Spacing and radii

Adopt consistent spacing increments (4/8px) and larger touch targets (44–48px min height).
Radii tokens: sm 6px, md 10px, lg 14px, xl 20px; pill for special CTAs.
Shadows: use subtle shadows sparingly, favor tonal elevation (M3 Elevation guidance).
Motion and interaction

Default to spring-based transitions (Framer Motion) with subtle overshoot for hero moments; standard scheme for utilitarian actions.
Respect prefers-reduced-motion and use effect springs for opacity/color changes (M3 Motion physics).
Keep durations 180–280ms; micro-overshoot on primary buttons and cards.
Breakpoints and containers

Mobile-first classes; use a consistent container and safe-area padding (env(safe-area-inset-*)).
Grid rhythm: 2-col on mobile, 3–4 on tablet, 5–6 on desktop for wardrobes.
Navigation and Structure
Global layout (layout.tsx)

Apply bg-background text-text on the body; wrap children in a container with horizontal padding and safe-area insets.
Add a mobile bottom navigation bar (sticky, Liquid Glass-like frosted surface; Apple HIG: tab bars visible and labeled).
Tabs: Home, Wardrobe, Create, History, Profile.
Use icons (Heroicons) + short labels; highlight active with a pill or underline.
Keep top headers minimal; use sticky headers with subtle blur only when needed.
Routing and flows

Eliminate ”Back to Home” buttons; rely on persistent bottom nav.
Prefetch key routes on viewport to reduce latency.
Page-level Improvements
Home (page.tsx)

Unify with dark theme (remove gray-50 background); introduce a hero with crisp heading, short value prop, and a primary CTA.
If logged in, surface “Daily Picks” with a compact card stack teaser; show “Continue where you left off.”
Add subtle entry animation using spring (no large y-translation; small fade+rise).
Login (page.tsx)

Replace white card with elevated tonal surface; larger inputs, clear labels, and inline validation (no alert boxes).
One primary action (Sign in), secondary action (Create account) as subdued; Google button styled as neutral.
Add password reveal, error messages inline below inputs; disable on submit with spinner.
Keep copy minimal — premium tone.
Wardrobe (page.tsx, grid, cards, upload)

Filter + sort bar: compress into a single control with chips for categories; use select bottom sheet on mobile.
Grid cards: consistent aspect ratio, rounded-lg/xl, thin border (border-white/10), subtle hover elevation (desktop).
Use next/image blur placeholders; ensure width/height provided to eliminate CLS.
Swipe-to-delete gesture on mobile: keep but add confirmation via inline undo toast (replace modal for destructive actions after swipe).
Empty state: friendly illustration, single CTA “Add your first item” linking to Upload.
Create Outfit (DND flow)

Two zones stacked on mobile (Wardrobe list collapsed to categories, Creation zone at top).
Larger drop zone with dashed border and hint; subtle bounce when item is dropped (spatial spring).
Add a sticky footer for “Name outfit” + primary Save button (full-width on mobile).
Avoid alerts; use toast success and keep user in context (clear creation zone with a soft success checkmark animation).
History

Infinite scroll with skeleton placeholders; clear date grouping; compact cards with small metadata line.
Empty state with “You haven’t rated any outfits yet. Try recommendations.”
Profile

Convert to dark-themed surfaces; improve avatar uploader with circular preview and progress indicator.
Use segmented controls or simple list forms; emphasize Save with sticky bottom CTA.
Component-level Upgrades
Buttons

Variants: primary (solid), secondary (tonal), outline, ghost, destructive.
Sizes: md (44px), lg (48px). Animated press (scale 0.98) and focus ring (ring-primary/40).
Icon buttons with accessible labels.
Inputs

Filled surface input style (bg-surface, border-transparent, focus ring).
Inline validation states (success/error icons), helper text, and descriptive labels.
Replace native multi-select with stacked chips + bottom sheet selector on mobile.
Cards

Use surface-2 with border and light shadow; consistent padding and iconography.
For wardrobe items, add overlay quick actions (Edit, Delete) on long-press or hover.
Modals

Use them sparingly; favor inline confirmation + undo toasts.
If modal required, dim with 50–60% overlay; centered with measured spacing and large tappable actions.
Toaster

Introduce a toast system to replace alert() calls (success/error/info). Non-blocking, dismissible, live region for a11y.
Skeletons and loaders

Skeleton components for grid/list cards and form fields.
Replace text “Loading...” with shimmering blocks.
Page transitions

Keep transitions light (opacity + tiny translateY 6–8px); use route-level transitions with shared spring token.
Avoid heavy bounce during route changes; reserve expressive motion for card stack or hero CTA.
Accessibility and Mobile Ergonomics
Color contrast: Ensure minimum AA contrast for all text (especially muted text-light).
Focus styles: Visible focus rings on interactive elements; keyboard navigable.
Hit areas: 44–48px min; give buttons/links sufficient space.
Prefers-reduced-motion: Respect and switch to non-animated fades.
ARIA live regions for toasts and form errors; descriptive alt text for images (fallback to category).
Performance and Quality
next/image everywhere with blur placeholder; ensure defined width/height; set priority for above-the-fold images.
Reduce CLS by reserving space for headers/nav/toasts.
Use CSS transitions for small effects; reserve Framer Motion for gestures/layout transitions.
Avoid re-sorting mutating arrays in-place in useMemo; clone before sort to prevent state bugs.
Prefetch critical routes; cache read-heavy lists; paginate grids with IntersectionObserver (already present in history list).
Lint for a11y and consistent className ordering.
Theming and Dark/Light Support
Option 1: Go all-in on premium dark theme with high-quality accent and tonal surfaces.
Option 2: Add light theme and a toggle (data-theme attribute), mapping all tokens in @theme using Tailwind v4 “inline” variables.
Ensure consistent styles across all pages (Home/Login currently conflict with global dark).
Concrete changes mapped to your code
globals.css

Redefine @theme tokens for colors, text scale, radii, shadows, spacing, breakpoints.
Import a premium font (Inter/Geist via @font-face or next/font) and set --font-sans.
Add base styles for body, safe-area padding utilities, and a .container utility pattern if needed.
layout.tsx

Set className="bg-background text-text antialiased" on body.
Add a shared <BottomNav /> component and a <Toaster /> portal; wrap main content in a container with px-4 and pb-[calc(56px+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))].
Keep PageTransition but tune motion to smaller deltas and spring timing.
New shared components

components/BottomNav.tsx with 5 tabs and safe-area support.
components/ToastProvider.tsx to consolidate notifications.
components/Skeleton.tsx variants (card, line, avatar).
components/Button.tsx and components/Input.tsx for consistent styling and states.
Replace alerts with toasts

Files: AuthButton.tsx, page.tsx, UploadForm.tsx, WardrobeGrid.tsx, ItemEditForm.tsx, create-outfit/*, history/*.
Provide inline errors for form fields; use toast for global success/error.
Harmonize pages to dark theme

page.tsx, page.tsx: remove gray backgrounds, switch to surfaces and toned content.
Navigation: remove “Back to Home” CTAs; rely on bottom nav.
Wardrobe ergonomics

WardrobeGrid.tsx: chip filters, unified select UI, skeletons while loading; WardrobeItemCard.tsx with accessible gestures and non-obtrusive delete confirm (toast undo).
Create Outfit flow

OutfitCreator.tsx, WardrobePanel.tsx, CreationZone.tsx: stack on mobile, sticky save bar, clearer dropzone affordances, gentle motion on drop.
Visual style cues to feel “premium”
High-contrast, matte background with soft luminous accents; restrained gradients and subtle glass on the bottom nav.
Thin borders with slight translucency (border-white/10); larger corners and clean whitespace.
Meaningful motion: tiny, confident movements instead of large bouncy transitions.
Crisp iconography (Heroicons/Phosphor) with consistent stroke weights.
Prioritized rollout plan (suggested)
Core foundation (tokens, typography, layout, bottom nav, toaster, skeletons).
Unify all pages to dark theme, remove alerts, add toasts.
Wardrobe UI polish (filters, cards, gestures, empty states, skeletons).
Create Outfit ergonomics (mobile-first stacking, dropzone feedback, sticky save).
Login/Profile modernization (form styles, validation, avatar UX).
Motion tuning pass (route transitions, micro-interactions) with reduced-motion handling.
Accessibility and contrast audit; fix gaps.

Unify Home and Login to the dark theme and remove alert() calls in favor of a toast.
Add a sticky bottom nav for mobile and remove “Back to Home” links.
Introduce skeletons for wardrobe/history grids to replace “Loading...” text.
Switch font to Inter/Geist and adjust headings/body sizes per the scale above.
If you want, I can implement the foundation (design tokens, bottom nav, toaster, and updating Home/Login to the new look) in a first PR so you can feel the new visual direction end-to-end.
