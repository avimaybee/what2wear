1. 🌟 Product Vision

To create a personal AI stylist that helps users look their best every day.
The app lets users:

Digitally catalogue their wardrobe (shirts, t-shirts, jackets, pants, shoes, accessories).

Upload a realistic 3D/photorealistic model of themselves via a full-body photo.

Receive season-aware, fashion-forward daily outfit recommendations that never repeat in a week.

See a generated image of themselves wearing the selected outfit every night — so they’re ready for the next morning.

The product merges AI styling intelligence + virtual try-on for a seamless, personalized experience.

2. 🎯 Objectives

Deliver highly personalized daily outfits using the user’s actual clothes.

Maximize variety (no repeated outfits in a 7-day cycle).

Ensure recommendations feel aesthetically curated, not random.

Integrate Gemini for reasoning and styling and Nano Banana for image synthesis and try-on visuals.

Provide a smooth, modern, responsive webapp experience on both desktop and mobile.

3. 👤 Target Users

Fashion-conscious individuals who want effortless daily styling.

Busy professionals and students who don’t want to waste time deciding what to wear.

People who want to make the most of their existing wardrobe rather than buying new clothes.

4. 🗝️ Core Features
4.1 Onboarding & Account Setup

Sign up/login: via email, Google, Apple, or social accounts.

Wardrobe photo upload: user uploads each clothing item individually against a plain background.

Clothing categorization: automated categorization (shirt, t-shirt, jacket, pants, shoes, accessories) + option for manual correction.

Full-body model creation:

User uploads a well-lit, front-facing full-body photo.

AI cleans the image (removes background, normalizes lighting).

Nano Banana generates a realistic avatar of the user for outfit visualization.

4.2 Wardrobe Management

Item details: category, color, fabric, season suitability, style tag (e.g., casual, formal, streetwear).

Season tags: automatically inferred using AI, editable by user.

Image cleanup: background removal & standardization.

Wardrobe analytics: show counts by category and season (e.g., 12 shirts, 4 jackets, 5 pairs of jeans).

4.3 Daily Outfit Recommendations

Recommendation engine:

Uses Gemini to:

Match complementary colors and styles.

Consider current season & upcoming weather.

Avoid repeating outfit combos in a 7-day window.

Adapt to context (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends).

User can adjust preferences (e.g., more casual, more formal, warmer, trendier).

Visual presentation:

Nano Banana renders the user wearing the selected outfit.

Outfit is displayed in a clean, minimal layout (date + preview image).

Scheduling:

Generates the next day’s outfit at night (configurable time).

Push/email notifications: “Your outfit for tomorrow is ready!”

4.4 Outfit History & Insights

Outfit timeline: scrollable past week/month view.

Stats: which items are worn most/least often.

User feedback loop:

Like/dislike/re-rate outfits.

AI refines future recommendations accordingly.

4.5 Seasonal Adaptation

The system checks user location (with permission) to adjust recommendations based on:

Weather forecast (temperature, humidity, rain).

Season-specific colors/styles.

Layering guidance for colder climates.

4.6 Admin & AI Training Dashboard (Internal)

Monitor user interactions.

Evaluate recommendation success/failure rates.

Improve model styling logic via human-in-the-loop corrections.

5. 📱 User Flows (Step-by-Step)

Flow 1: First-Time Setup

User signs up → chooses region (for seasonal data).

Uploads full-body photo → AI creates clean model.

Uploads wardrobe photos → AI detects categories/colors/seasons.

Gets onboarding tutorial on using the app.

Flow 2: Daily Outfit Cycle

Each evening, app pings Gemini → selects outfit.

Outfit is rendered by Nano Banana → generates image of user wearing the outfit.

User gets notification → opens app → sees next day’s look.

Next day: user marks “wore it” or gives feedback.

Flow 3: Wardrobe Updates

User adds new clothing → categorized automatically.

Recommendations adapt immediately.
