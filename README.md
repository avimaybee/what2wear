# What2Wear: Your Personal AI Stylist

What2Wear is a context-aware, highly personalized, daily decision engine for your outfits. It's not just another weather app; it's a sophisticated AI-powered stylist that learns your preferences and helps you make the most of your wardrobe.

## Vision

Our vision is to eliminate the daily "what to wear" dilemma. We aim to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for users to manage their wardrobe, discover new styles, and feel confident in their clothing choices every day. We believe that by leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, we can provide a truly personalized and valuable service to our users.

## Features

### Core Features

*   **Virtual Wardrobe:** Easily add, categorize, and manage your clothing items. You can upload images, add details like brand, color, and material, and even track the last time you wore an item.
*   **Context-Aware Recommendations:** Our recommendation engine takes into account multiple factors to suggest the perfect outfit:
    *   **Weather:** Real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and chance of precipitation.
    *   **Calendar Events:** The app syncs with your calendar to suggest appropriate attire for your appointments, whether it's a business meeting or a casual brunch.
    *   **Activity Level:** What2Wear considers your planned activities for the day to ensure your outfit is comfortable and practical.
*   **Personalized Suggestions:** Our machine learning models learn your style preferences over time. The more you use the app and provide feedback on the recommendations, the better it gets at suggesting outfits you'll love.
*   **Outfit Logging:** Keep a visual diary of your daily outfits. This helps you track your style evolution and avoid repeating outfits too often.

### Advanced Features

*   **Smart Closet Analysis:** Get insights into your wardrobe, such as which items you wear the most and which ones you haven't worn in a while.
*   **Style Discovery:** Discover new outfit combinations and styles based on your existing wardrobe.
*   **Travel Packing Lists:** The app can help you pack for trips by suggesting a wardrobe based on your destination's weather and your planned activities.

## System Architecture

What2Wear is built on a modern, scalable, and serverless architecture.

*   **Frontend:** The frontend is a Next.js application built with React and TypeScript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and shadcn/ui for UI components. The app is designed to be fully responsive and work seamlessly on all devices.
*   **Backend:** The backend is powered by Supabase, a backend-as-a-service platform that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and instant APIs.
*   **Serverless Functions:** We use Supabase Functions for our serverless logic, such as the daily outfit recommender and creating outfits.

## Machine Learning Models

Our recommendation engine uses a combination of machine learning models to provide personalized suggestions:

*   **Event Classifier:** This model classifies your calendar events into different categories (e.g., work, social, formal) to help determine the appropriate level of formality for your outfit.
*   **Preference Learning:** We use a preference learning model to understand your style. This model takes your feedback on recommended outfits and learns what you like and dislike.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** The core of our recommendation system, this engine combines all the inputs (weather, calendar, activity, user preferences) to generate the final outfit recommendations.
